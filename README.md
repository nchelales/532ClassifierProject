Project Description:

Implementation of image classification on CIFAR-10 algorithm using KNN, SVM, and CNN.

Feature Sets Used to Build Individual Models for KNN and SVM:      
			
RGB, HSV, LAB histogram bin values
RGB Raw Pixel Values
GrayScale Raw Pixel Values

Feature Sets Used to Build Individual CNN Models:

RGB Images
HSV Images
LAB Images
Grayscale Images



File For Results Are Grouped by Algorithm and Feature Set Used to Build Each Model
