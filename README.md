# 532ClassifierProject
Term project for ECE 532 Fall 2020 at the University of Wisconsin Madison
Nick Chelales
Project Description:

Implementation of image classification on CIFAR-10 algorithm using KNN, SVM, and CNN.

Feature Sets Used to Build Individual Models for KNN and SVM:      
			
RGB, HSV, LAB histogram bin values
RGB Raw Pixel Values
GrayScale Raw Pixel Values

Feature Sets Used to Build Individual CNN Models:

RGB Images
HSV Images
LAB Images
Grayscale Images


File For Results Are Grouped by Algorithm and Feature Set Used to Build Each Model.

There is only one python file, which is divided into three separate sections (KNN, SVM, and CNN). Each section is separate by a long string of " #####" to denote sections. If one section is desired to be run only, comment out the other sections and run so forth. Outputs will automatically be saved in the same file naming convention as are in the GitHub repo (.csv and .png files).
